/*
We need a function prime_bef_aft() that gives 
the largest prime below a certain given value n,
and the smallest prime larger than this value.

The result should be output in a list like the following:
  primeBefAft == [befPrime, aftPrime]
  If n is a prime number it will give two primes, 
  n will not be included in the result.

Let's see some cases:
  primeBefAft(100) == [97, 101]
  primeBefAft(97) == [89, 101]
  primeBefAft(101) == [97, 103]
